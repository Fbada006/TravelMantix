This code is built from the course Creating Your First Android App with Android Studio and Firebase
by Simone Alessandria on Pluralsight.
One thing to keep in mind is the way the download URI and the link to the images in the Firebase Storage are retrived.
Also, remember to connect the app with firebase and add the google-services.gson file to the project. More on that here https://firebase.google.com/docs/android/setup?authuser=0#console
